Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors 
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.
 
Expected Output:

If the file exists:

<img width="643" height="86" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fabf3cfa-63fa-4873-a520-75ff571e58cb" />

If the file does not exist:

<img width="624" height="54" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7ae5037-cc55-475c-9289-39e2940c929d" />


Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.
 

Expected Output:
 For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:
 
<img width="646" height="232" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a72c7bd-3404-46a8-8be5-908f59fd7150" />
